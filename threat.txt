What is threat?

Threat is the likelihood that a team scores from some location of the pitch. This is not a new concept; it was introduced in 2011 and popularized in 2018.

However, typical threat models do not factor in the phase of play. For example, a location becomes significantly more dangerous when a free kick is taken from that location (as oppossed to possessing the ball there in open play). My threat maps take phase of play into account, which becomes especially important when assigning value to player actions.

Given a way to determine threat and detailed event data for a game, it becomes possible to assign value to each action. For example, a cross from the touchline into the box moves the ball from an area with relatively low threat to an area with a very high threat. Assuming the pass was complete, the pass created an amount of threat that can be quantified.

This idea, too, is not new. What I've done is included more nuance in my approach (taking into account different ways threat can be gained and lost) and assigning threat to almost every type of action--not just passes and dribbles.

The result is a holistic way to look at players' performance. I subdivide threat into four categories:
- created: change in threat as a result of moving the ball in possession (can be negative)
- lost: change in threat as a result of losing possession
- prevented: change in threat as a result of an action out of possession (similar to created, just defensive)
- conceded: change in threat as a result of giving the opposition the ball 
From these four categories, 3 more can be generated:
- offensive: threat created - threat lost. Offensive threat is very comparable to xG (and even has slightly better correlation with goals scored)
- defensive: threat prevented - threat conceded. Defensive threat allows us to look at how many goals a player prevents/allows out of possession
- total: offensive + defensive. Total threat is an incredibly effective predictor of game outcomes and effectively tells how much a player's actions should impact the scoreline.

Each action a player takes is assigned a threat value. Many actions only impact 1 of the 4 basic types of threat. Many others impact 2 (for example, losing possession adds to threat lost and threat conceded to account for the loss of a scoring opportunity and the creation of one for the other team)

Determining how an action impacts threat is sometimes straightforward (for example, passing). Often, however, there is some ambiguity. When I made these determinations, I followed a few basic principles:
- Every defensive action should have direct offensive equivalents. For example, winning a duel should ALWAYS be accompanied by loss of possession for the offense. Ideally, this works in reverse, but in reality it's impossible to assign defensive threats to actions such as passing and carrying.
- In general, threat created/lost/prevented/conceded is simply threat after - threat before. This means that sometimes a player is penalized or rewarded for the actions of other players or the unintended consequences of their own actions. I am comfortable with this given the size of the dataset; any anomalies should work themselves out in aggregate or be indicative of actual footballing ability.
- One action results in a change in threat by one player. If an action affects multiple players, there should be multiple events in the data that allow each player's action to be accounted for. This is related to #1.

Looking at games this way has a few distinct advantages and applications:
- Threat is positionless. Threat provides a way to directly compare the contributions of every player on the field regardless of position. While threat does not fully capture the defensive side of the game (due to insufficient data and the general difficulty of quantifying defensive performance in sports), it remains incredibly effective in comparing players across positions.
- Threat has direct meaning. Because threat created is by definition the number of goals you would expect a player to create (likewise for lost/prevented/conceded), threat translates directly to what wins games.
- Combining threat with the location of events allows us to look at not just where a player *is* (like a traditional heatmap) but where a player is dangerous. Additionally, this data can be compared to the average at a player's position to see where they are more and less dangerous than their peers.
